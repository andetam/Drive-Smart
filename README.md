# Project Details

## Project Title: Drive-Smart

## Problem Statement:
Every day more and more there is a need to be on the move and the way to make the movement even simpler is to use the car. Regardless of other alternative ways, the use of a personal car offers comfort, flexibility and above all you have the opportunity to move based on your needs, adapting to your schedules. Also, we notice that recently the number of tourists has increased in our country, and the majority of them are obviously looking for a safe trip, suitable to the schedules theirs and above all at a low cost, all the more so that most of them choose to visit Albania during the summer, when the movement becomes even more difficult by bus or even by car. by taxi, where we often hear cases where most of the companies, due to the influx, do not even have the opportunity to respond and provide the service, therefore the best way would be to rent a car. In recent years, this service has been provided even more popular among Albanians and foreigners, but this service is still lacking in our country, this is because most of the businesses are not known because they do not have a proper marketing. Most of them operate through an Instagram page, where there is a facility they are incomplete, and they need improvement. Most of these pages only show images of cars, and not very clear information about the schedule, prices, and often customers feel in difficulty and simply choose to give up.

## Solution Proposed:
To improve the clients way of traveling, we offer an application called Drive-Smart which allows the users to make a safe journey, and also allows them to reserve the car that they want. With this innovative application, customers can choose the car they prefer in a quick and simple way.Also, in this application, we offer all the information that users needs about the car,  information about the type of car, the rental price, the dates of free to reserve the car etc. We think that in this way the work of the business and also of the client is simplified.
