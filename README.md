# Project Details

## Project Title: Drive-Smart

## Problem Statement:
Every day more and more there is a need to be on the move and the way to make the movement even simpler is to use the car. Regardless of other alternative ways, the use of a personal car offers comfort, flexibility and above all you have the opportunity to move based on your needs, adapting to your schedules. Also, we notice that recently the number of tourists has increased in our country, and the majority of them are obviously looking for a safe trip, suitable to the schedules theirs and above all at a low cost, all the more so that most of them choose to visit Albania during the summer, when the movement becomes even more difficult by bus or even by car. by taxi, where we often hear cases where most of the companies, due to the influx, do not even have the opportunity to respond and provide the service, therefore the best way would be to rent a car. In recent years, this service has been provided even more popular among Albanians and foreigners, but this service is still lacking in our country, this is because most of the businesses are not known because they do not have a proper marketing. Most of them operate through an Instagram page, where there is a facility they are incomplete, and they need improvement. Most of these pages only show images of cars, and not very clear information about the schedule, prices, and often customers feel in difficulty and simply choose to give up.

## Solution Proposed:
To improve the clients way of traveling, we offer an application called Drive-Smart which allows the users to make a safe journey, and also allows them to reserve the car that they want. With this innovative application, customers can choose the car they prefer in a quick and simple way.Also, in this application, we offer all the information that users needs about the car,  information about the type of car, the rental price, the dates of free to reserve the car etc. We think that in this way the work of the business and also of the client is simplified.



## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The purpose of  DRIVE-SMART is to offer an innovative application in a convenient way to facilitate the process of choosing cars and to offer an excellent service to the users of this application.Through this application we will offer a great variety of cars to suit the preferences and demands of customers.
- **Main Objectives:**
  1. Simplify the process

Submission Deadline: 18.03.2024, 23:59 
# 1. Chosen Development Model: 
## Waterfall
## Justification:
The systematic and sequential approach of waterfall development, which can be advantageous for projects with clearly specified and solid needs up front, is the reason why the automobile rental application was developed using this methodology. Within the automobile rental sector, where specifications might not alter regularly and a thorough plan can be created beforehand, Waterfall offers an organised approach to moving through several project stages.

## Requirements Gathering:
 In the Waterfall approach, compiling and recording all of the prerequisites for the vehicle rental application is the first step. Understanding user requirements, desirable features, and corporate goals are all part of this. During this stage, stakeholders including administrators, clients, and end users offer their opinions.
## Design: 
The process starts as soon as the criteria are decided upon. This entails drafting comprehensive requirements for the database design, user interface, and system architecture. The application's functionality and layout are visualised through the creation of wireframes and mockups.
## Implementation: 
After receiving the design specifications, the development team begins writing the programme in accordance with the specified specifications. The entire vehicle rental application is made up of all the system's built-in components.
## Testing: 
Extensive testing is carried out following the implementation phase to guarantee that the application satisfies the requirements and operates as intended. To find and address any faults or problems, this comprises unit, integration, and system testing.
## Deployment: 
The application is put into production environments after testing is finished and it is judged ready for public release. This include configuring databases, setting up servers, and granting end users access to the application.
## Maintenance:
 When an application is deployed, it goes into a maintenance phase where any updates, patches, or repairs that are required are performed. This guarantees that the application will function efficiently and without interruption over time.

# 2. User Requirements:

# 5. Application Specifications: 
## a. Architecture:
For the rental car application, a microservices architecture was selected.
Overview: Several separate microservices make up the system, and each is in charge of handling a particular set of tasks like booking, user management, processing payments, and inventory management. Through APIs, these microservices can interact with one another.
Components:
- **User Service **
- **Booking Service **
- **Payment Service **
- **Inventory Service **
- **Notification Service **
Interactions: RESTful APIs allow microservices to communicate asynchronously with one another. For instance, when a user submits a request for a reservation, the Reservation Service gets in touch with the Inventory Service to see if a car is available and the Payment Service to handle the payment.

Foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity.
Unique constraints on email addresses for Users.
Constraints on payment amounts for Payments.

## c. Technologies Used: 
It is yet to be worked on it.

## d. User Interface Design: 
Mockups and wireframes (Offer links to mockups or wireframes, or explain the UI design). The user interface's straightforward and user-friendly design makes it simple for customers to manage their accounts, search for cars, and make reservations.
## e. Security Measures: 
- **Encryption:** To prevent unwanted access, user passwords are hashed with bcrypt before being stored in the database.
-**Authentication:** To provide a safe method for managing sessions, JWTs, or JSON Web Tokens, are utilised for user authentication.
  -**Authorization: ** To limit access to specific capabilities depending on user roles (e.g., admin, regular user), role-based access control, or RBAC, is established.
   -**HTTPS:** To secure data transfer over the network, all client-server communication is encrypted using the HTTPS protocol.
  -**Input validation:** To guard against injection attacks and guarantee data integrity, input validation is applied on both the client and server sides.
